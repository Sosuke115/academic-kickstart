Hi, I’m Sosuke Nishikawa (西川荘介). 

I am a master's student in Information Science and Technology at the University of Tokyo. 
My primary research interests lie in Natural Language Processing. In particular, I am currently interested in multilingual models, named entity, pretrained models, and adversarial examples.
